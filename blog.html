									<h1>DFAB Blog</h1>
									<p>This Blog includes documentation on what I've learnt from DFAB lessons, like basic digital fabrication skills and technologies such as computer-aided design (CAD), 2D and 3D modelling, laser cutting, 3D printing as well as mechanical & electronic design and programming skills. </p>

								<span class="date">Week 1: Fab Lab Safety Precautions</span>
								<p>During the first week of DFAB lessons, I was introduced to the basic safety precautions that have to be taken into account while being in the FabLab.
									As a quick summary, before entering the FabLab, we should firstly ensure that we are in the proper attire such as long pants, no long sleeves & adornments as well as covered shoes.
									While handling equipment, we should be knowledgeable about the different symbols and lastly, know what to do when an emergency occurs. 
									The FabLab is definitely not a playground and people can get hurt if the equipment is not properly handled. Hence, we should be vigilant and alert while in the FabLab in order to prevent incidents from occurring</p>
									<span class="date">Week 2: Web Development</span>
								<p>During the second week of DFAB lessons, I was introduced to the fundamentals of HTML & CSS, both of which play important roles in the development of a website. 
									To summarise, HTML is used to format the structure and content of a website while CSS is used to style and give a website its look and feel. 
									Since I had little to no prior knowledge regarding coding/programming a website, I relied on tutorial videos from Jake Wright in order to come up with a basic website that featured the bare minimum of HTML & CSS.
									Although I found it pretty difficult to keep up, in the end I was able to have a deeper understanding on what code affects different aspects of the website as well as how to change certain parts of the website itself.</p>
									<span class="date">Week 3: Computer Aided Design</span>
								<p>During the third week of DFAB lessons, I was introduced to the program Fusion 360, which is one of the many softwares used for computer aided design. 
									I was absolutely clueless on how to operate Fusion 360 as it was the first time I have used this software so I struggled when doing the Music Box Exercise, as I was confused on how to create sketches, how to use extrude, etc...
									Thankfully, I was guided by the helpful lecturers and soon after, I felt like I had a basic understanding on how to use this program.
									When it was time to move on to the Knight's Chess Piece, I found it much easier to complete as compared to the music box as I have experience with the drawing/pen tool as I use Adobe Illustrator rather frequently & struggled less while making the Knight's Chess Piece
									All in all, I was fascinated by computer aided design as I have never really done a 3D design on an object before and I felt accomplished in the end.</p>
									<span class="date">Week 4-5: Laser Cutting</span>
									<p>During the 4th to 5th week of DFAB lessons, I was introduced to the Laser Cutting.....</p>

									<span class="date">Week 6: 3D Printing</span>
